                    <h2>Our Certificate & Online Programs For 2022</h2>
                     <p>   All the certificates are issued as per the progress of the students and available after the completion.
                           By moving the ToC course online, with online tests after each module, the course is now designed to take approximately two months but you can go at your own pace.
                      <br>  
                      <p>   All comprehensive material from the original course remains, plus suggested readings.
                            Each student will receive a syllabus of reading per module, and then take an online test.  
                            Upon passing the test, they move to the next module. If a student doesn’t pass, they can re-take the test. 
                            The course is designed to teach both basic and advanced Theory of Change concepts, but it does not teach facilitation. 
                            However, those who choose can add a module on facilitation tips.</p>
